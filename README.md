# Poe
> Thank you for showing interest in this project. I would really love to hear what you think about Poe so send me an email to Ryan Riffle <ryanriffle@icloud.com> and let me know what you think.

A word processor created with web technologies. Poe is written to be used with
Google Chrome or Electron. It could theoretically be used in any standards
compliant browser however other browsers have not been tested.

To see an overview of how Poe works internally check out the [wiki](https://www.github.com/RyanRiffle/Poe/wiki). The wiki has important information about the design of the project and the direction in which the project is going.

## Usage
Open your web browser and use  `Control + O` or `Cmd + O` to open the `index.html` file. If it is broken in your browser please create an issue in Poe's [issue tracker](https://www.github.com/RyanRiffle/Poe/issues).

## Building

cd Poe
npm install
grunt
```
