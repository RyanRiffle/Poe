Poe.js
======

A word processor built with a html, css, javascript. It came about as I began to use Elementary OS which is the new kid on the block, and users of Elementary were hoping for a simple but elegant word processor. This application is following [Writer Concept](http://bassultra.deviantart.com/art/Writer-Concept-351501580) by spiceofdesign on DeviantArt.

The application is under heavy development. However it is up on [Heroku](https://poejs.herokuapp.com/) for a preview
and the heroku page will always be the same as the stable master branch.

#### Note
Poe has only been tested in Google Chrome at this time since it is being used in the development process.
