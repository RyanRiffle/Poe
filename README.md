Poe
======

A word processor built with HTML, CSS, and CoffeeScript. The current goal of Poe is to have a working word processor base. Then loading and saving will be implemented. This application is following [Writer Concept](http://bassultra.deviantart.com/art/Writer-Concept-351501580) by spiceofdesign on DeviantArt.

The application is under heavy development. However it is up on [Heroku](https://poejs.herokuapp.com/) for a preview and the heroku page will always be the same as the stable master branch.

### Documentation
The documentation can be generated using codo.
```
    npm install -g codo
```
then while in the root directory of the project
```
    codo coffee/*
```
The documentation is stored in `doc`

#### Note
Poe has only been tested in Google Chrome at this time since it is being used in the development process.
